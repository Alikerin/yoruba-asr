# Yoruba Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
This repository contains data and code for the 2020 African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) Speech Recognition Course. It contains 132 minutes of diacritized Yoruba read speech. The corpus which contains 1001 sentences was sourced from https://github.com/Niger-Volta-LTI/yoruba-text. The data was collected using LIG-Aikuma (https://lig-aikuma.imag.fr/). The model training code relies heavily on the implementation of Constrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPC_audio.
